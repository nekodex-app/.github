# NekoDex

NekoDex is a free desktop application designed to keep track of your favourite anime titles without any clutter.

This app is capable of...

- Managing a database that is only stored on your device and not anywhere else. This ensures that the ownership is provided to you and nobody else.

- Allowing you to add titles either by hand or through MyAnimeList. You have full control over your list, so use it to your hearts content.

- Entries can be both imported from and exported to a JSON file. This can be useful if you want to move your list somewhere else or you want to make sure it stays safe.

- No ads, no tracking, no spyware, no worries!


## Disclaimer

This program is a work-in-progress and bugs may be present.

Please be aware that this is a hobby project and I won't be working on this full-time. Although this program uses MyAnimeList to search for titles, it has no association with MyAnimeList and Gaudiy Inc.
